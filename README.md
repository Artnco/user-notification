<h1>Welcome</h1>
<b>You're about to discover a Wordpress module that lets you easily create a notification system between 2 users, using Jetengine and Jetformbuilder.</b><br>
This module lets you:
<ul>
	<li> Add a "bell" icon wherever you want, with an automatic notification counter (with a shortcode), without reloading the page</li> 
	<li> Choose where to redirect the user when the icon is clicked.</li>
	<li> Change the color of the icon and counter</li>
	<li> Send an email to the user who received the message</li>
	<li> Modify email title and body</li>
</ul>
We're at the Alpha version of development, so there's a lot of testing to do before we can release the module definitively, and we need your help.

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Wordpress 6.2.0 minimum</li>
<li> Jetengine (to create a custom post type and a meta field)</li>
<li> Jetformbuilder (to create the request form)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up:</h2> 
1 - First of all, you need to create a custom post type in your Wordpress. 
You can use Jetengine, or any other module. (Tutorial from Crocoblock to help you: https://crocoblock.com/knowledge-base/jetengine/how-to-create-a-custom-post-type-based-on-jetengine-plugin/).
For our example, we'll call it "Messages".
