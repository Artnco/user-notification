<h1>Welcome</h1>
<b>You're about to discover a Wordpress module that lets you easily create a notification system between 2 users, using Jetengine and Jetformbuilder.</b><br>
This module lets you:
<ul>
	<li> Add a "bell" icon wherever you want, with an automatic notification counter (with a shortcode), without reloading the page</li> 
	<li> Choose where to redirect the user when the icon is clicked.</li>
	<li> Change the color of the icon and counter</li>
	<li> Send an email to the user who received the message</li>
	<li> Modify email title and body</li>
</ul>
We're at the Alpha version of development, so there's a lot of testing to do before we can release the module definitively, and we need your help.

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li> Wordpress 6.2.0 minimum</li>
<li> Jetengine (to create a custom post type and a meta field)</li>
<li> Jetformbuilder (to create the request form)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up:</h2> 
1 - First of all, you need to create a custom post type in your Wordpress.<br> 
You can use Jetengine, or any other module. (Tutorial from Crocoblock to help you: https://crocoblock.com/knowledge-base/jetengine/how-to-create-a-custom-post-type-based-on-jetengine-plugin/).<br>
For our example, we'll call it <b>"Messages"</b>.<br>
Then, once you've created your CPT, you need to add a meta text field, which you can call anything you like. We've called it <b>"id-user".</b><br><br>

<br><br>

2 - When this is done, you need to create a form, ideally with Jetformbuilder. To do this, you need to create various fields.â€¨
<ul>
<li> A first hidden field, user_id with the value "Current User ID".</li>
<li> A second field with the meta field created earlier, so in our example it's "id-user".</li>
<li> Then a last field to add the message</li>
</ul>

Then in the section: "Post Submit Actions", you need to add a new action "Insert/Update Post".
<ul>
<li> Fetch the previously created post type</li>
<li> The status of the post</li>
<li> And in map, we advise you to do as the example below.</li>
</ul>

Then update this part, as well as the form.<br>

For the rest, we'll assume that your marketplace has different users, with different product sheets/posts, so for the module to work, you'll need to integrate your jetformbuilder form on the post of the user who is to receive the message.
<br>For our example, we've created a marketplace with different posts created by different users. On one of the posts, we added a "Contact" button with an Elementor popup in action.<br><br>

And we integrated the Jetformbuilder form<br>
